## Description

This React front-end App functions as a professional Recipe Finder. Once the app is running (clicking on the Live URL above), the user will be presented with a main search bar to input recipe names or ingredients. Once the user clicks on the "Search" button, the app will fetch data from the Edamam API and display the results in a list. The user can then click on the recipe card to be redirected to a page with the recipe's detailed info. The user can also click on the "Save Recipe" button to save the recipe to their favorites list. The user can then click on the "Favorites" tab in the navbar to be redirected to their favorites list, where they can view all of their saved recipes. The user can also click on the "Remove" button to remove the recipe from their favorites list. Happy cooking!
